Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-threatening neurological emergency that requires rapid and accurate diagnosis. Manual interpretation of CT scans is time-consuming and subject to variability.
This project presents an end-to-end deep learning framework that:
  Detects presence of hemorrhage
  Classifies hemorrhage subtype
  Provides interpretable outputs for clinical support

Hemorrhage Types Classified:
  Epidural Hemorrhage (EDH)
  Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH)
  Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)
  Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage (IPH)
  Intraventricular Hemorrhage (IVH)

Dataset used : a subset of the [RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection Dataset(2019)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jhoward/rsna-hemorrhage-jpg)
